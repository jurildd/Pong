# Pong

Game Information:

A simple ping-pong-like game. The first player to reach the score of 3 wins the game.

Every tenth (10th) bounce of the ball, a powerup will be available for both players.

Once the powerup is activated, the ball will travel much faster heading to the opposing player's racquet.

Enjoy!
